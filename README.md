Project Overview:

Currency Conversion is a decentralized web application built on top of Scaffold-ETH 2, designed to provide real-time Ethereum (ETH) to fiat currency conversions. This project bridges on-chain Ethereum data with off-chain fiat currency values, allowing users to view the current ETH price in multiple fiat currencies through a clean and responsive interface.

Key Features:
Real-time ETH Price Tracking: Fetches and displays the latest Ethereum price against a wide range of fiat currencies.
Integration with RafaelCaso‚Äôs Currency Conversion API: Utilizes the RafaelCaso/currency-conversion-extension API for accurate and up-to-date conversion rates.
Scaffold-ETH 2 Powered: Leverages Scaffold-ETH 2's modern development stack for rapid prototyping and a seamless Web3 UX.
Responsive Frontend UI: User-friendly interface that shows ETH price conversions in an intuitive table or card layout.
Ethereum Connected: Live wallet connection support using wagmi/hooks to reflect user's wallet status (optional extension).

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (via Scaffold-ETH 2)
Web3 Library: Wagmi, ethers.js
Backend API: RafaelCaso Currency Conversion Extension (REST API)
Scaffold-ETH 2: For smart contract interactions (even though this project focuses on off-chain data display)
Deployment: Vercel / Netlify / Localhost Dev Environment

Use Cases:
ETH price monitoring in local fiat currencies.
Educational showcase of integrating Web2 APIs into Web3 dApps.
Starter template for building financial dashboards on Scaffold-ETH 2.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- ü™ù **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- üß± [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- üî• **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- üîê **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
